dotfiles
========

Just a collection of my dotfiles. Its such a drag to have to setup a new system to your own preferences. It always 
possible to forget those teeny tiny tweaks that you made to get your environment just perfect. So store them in Github.

Clone the repo and run the bash script `setupSymlinks.sh`.
